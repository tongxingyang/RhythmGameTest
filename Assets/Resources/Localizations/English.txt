STR_TG=The Game
STR_TMG=The Magic Tour
STR_TW=The Works
STR_ARCHIVE_01=Freddie Mercury designed Queen's logo based on the band members' horoscopes. Two lions for John and Roger, who are Leonians, one crab for Brian, a Cancerian, and two fairies for Freddie, a Virgoan.
STR_ARCHIVE_02=Brian May built his iconic guitar, the Red Special, from scratch by himself with his father. He would use it in absolutely every concert and album recording.
STR_ARCHIVE_03=Roger Taylor was studying dentistry at London Hospital Medical College when he met Brian May, who was doing a PhD in astronomy, at a bar at Imperial College around 1967. 
STR_ARCHIVE_04=When Queen started performing, the band wasn't happy with their bass players and changed 7 of them. In early 1971, John Deacon came to audition and on March 1, 1971, he became the fourth and final member of Queen.
STR_ARCHIVE_05=For the Sheer Heart Attack album cover photo shoot, the band members were smeared in Vaseline and sprayed with water.
STR_ARCHIVE_06=Sumo wrestlers were hired to keep overzealous fans off the stage during the Sheer Heart Attack concert at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo.
STR_ARCHIVE_07=Brian May prefers using a sixpence coin as a plectrum over a standard guitar pick. It offers more control and produces many sound variations.
STR_ARCHIVE_08=John Deacon is an electronics engineer by training. He built a custom guitar amplifier, the Deacy Amp, and it was used in many of Queen's works.
STR_ARCHIVE_09=The music video for "Bohemian Rhapsody" was filmed in just 4 hours. It was done north of London at Elstree Studios, which the band was using for rehearsal before a tour.
STR_ARCHIVE_10=Freddie was not very confident of his piano skills and felt nervous performing "Bohemian Rhapsody." And a concert on Christmas Eve in 1974 gave him more reasons to worry—it was broadcast live on TV and radio.
STR_ARCHIVE_11=The album A Night at the Opera took 4 months to record, at 6 different studios across the U.K. It was the most expensive rock album ever made at the time.
STR_ARCHIVE_12="Bohemian Rhapsody" was the only song on top of international charts in 3 decades—in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The acclaimed song won an Ivor Novello award in 1976, and was voted as the Song of the Millennium in 1999.
STR_ARCHIVE_13=Freddie's signature move with the top half of a mic stand was the result of an accident early in his career. The mic snapped mid-concert but he just continued performing.
STR_ARCHIVE_14=Queen attended a special horse race at Kempton Park Racecourse, outside of London, to promote their album A Day at the Races. The band members bet on the same horse without telling each other, and it won.
STR_ARCHIVE_15=A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races were named after movies filmed by the Marx Brothers in the 1930s. They even met with the actor Groucho Marx during one of their tours in America, and he praised their choice of album names.
STR_ARCHIVE_16=In the summer of 1976, Queen's concert in Hyde Park drew a crowd of over 150,000 people, the highest record for the venue.
STR_ARCHIVE_17=The music video for "We Will Rock You" was recorded in Roger Taylor's backyard. He had just purchased the house and hadn't even moved in yet.
STR_ARCHIVE_18=The iconic rhythm of "We Will Rock You" didn't use drums. The band, sound engineers, roadies, and even a tea lady in Wessex Studio in London stomped and clapped during the recording.
STR_ARCHIVE_19=EMI Records produced fiberglass stands in the form of robots to promote the News of the World album at vinyl shops. Each robot became a rare collectible item. Nowadays, they can be sold for up to USD 10,000.
STR_ARCHIVE_20=At the end of a concert in Liverpool, Freddie threw roses into the audience. A roadie had to take out the thorns in advance to avoid audience injuries.
STR_ARCHIVE_21=Freddie refused to fix his protruding teeth. He feared the operation would ruin his voice, so he left them alone.
STR_ARCHIVE_22=The album Jazz included various styles of music, but none of the songs were actually in jazz. The album is a favorite among fans and considered a true classic.
STR_ARCHIVE_23=The original cover of the "Fat Bottomed Girls" single featured a naked woman on a bicycle. The panties were drawn over the photo after stores in the U.S. refused to carry it.
STR_ARCHIVE_24=In July 1978, the band visited Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, for the first time. Freddie loved it so much that Queen eventually bought the studio. Jazz was the first album to include songs recorded there.
STR_ARCHIVE_25=Freddie wrote "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" while taking a bath in his hotel room and even had the piano brought to the tub.
STR_ARCHIVE_26=Freddie had several cats and loved to call home to chat with them while he was away during tours.
STR_ARCHIVE_27=After attending a concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson talked to the band backstage and advised them to release "Another One Bites the Dust" as a single. It became a massive hit.
STR_ARCHIVE_28=During the recording of John Deacon's song "Another One Bites the Dust" in Munich, Freddie hammered the vocal until his throat bled.
STR_ARCHIVE_29=The soundtrack album for Flash Gordon included dialogue and sounds from the movie. Since Flash Gordon, it has become commonplace to add phrases and effects from a movie to soundtrack albums.
STR_ARCHIVE_30=When producer Dino De Laurentiis heard the musical score in rock 'n' roll style proposed by Queen, he said: "It's very good but it is not for my movie." Film director Mike Hodges managed to persuade him.
STR_ARCHIVE_31=The song "Under Pressure" was co-written by David Bowie in Montreux, Switzerland, ahead of the main album recording. It was Queen's first collaboration with another artist and the song became a #1 hit on the charts.
STR_ARCHIVE_32=Queen decided to record the dance-oriented album Hot Space after the massive success of the single "Another One Bites the Dust" in both the U.K. and U.S. The album was recorded in Munich together with co-producer Reinhold Mack.
STR_ARCHIVE_33=Roger heard his 3-year-old son, Felix, saying "Radio Ca Ca" and wanted to name the song about radio, which Roger wrote, the same. But it was changed to "Radio Ga Ga" after discussing it with the band.
STR_ARCHIVE_34=In the memorable video for Freddie's song "It's a Hard Life," the band is dressed like opera actors. The video recreates Italian opera Pagliacci about a betrayed man who exacts his revenge while dressed as a clown.
STR_ARCHIVE_35=The drag video "I Want to Break Free" parodies the soap opera Coronation Street, which has run on British TV for more than 60 years. The idea came from Roger's then girlfriend.
STR_ARCHIVE_36=The video for Brian May's song "Hammer to Fall" was recorded on the opening night of The Works tour in Brussels. The song is about the threat of a nuclear war.
STR_ARCHIVE_37=The Wembley concert's stage was so heavy that supports had to be bored into the concrete foundations of the stadium. The lighting rig was the largest ever set up for a live show and weighed over 9.5 tons.
STR_ARCHIVE_38="One Vision" was inspired by participation in the Live Aid concert in 1985—a vision of a better world. And for the first time, the band was writing songs together and the album's songs were credited to all members.
STR_ARCHIVE_39=Several songs from the A Kind of Magic album were in the score of the movie Highlander. Even the title of the album was a phrase said by immortal character Connor MacLeod, played by Christopher Lambert.
STR_ARCHIVE_40=Queen's final show of the Magic tour took place at Knebworth Park, north of London, on August 9, 1986, before an audience estimated at up to 200,000. It would sadly prove to be Queen's very last concert with Freddie.
